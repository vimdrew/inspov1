# Testing

## Purpose

Tests are a fast validation layer for behavior that is difficult or risky to verify by reading alone. Keep test effort proportional to business risk; there is no coverage target. Prefer a small, high-signal suite, and add tests only when they protect meaningful behavior or reduce credible regression risk. Do not test trivial, impractical, or low-impact paths merely for completeness.

## What to Test

- Use Node-mode Vitest for pure domain rules, validation, authorization decisions, meaningful transformations, shared contracts, and regression-prone bug fixes.
- Use a local integration test when multiple owned modules or a real disposable local dependency must cooperate. Isolate its data and never use remote or production databases.
- Use Playwright for critical user journeys that unit tests cannot validate, such as auth entry points or multi-step onboarding.
- Keep TanStack server functions thin. Extract deterministic domain or handler logic and test it directly instead of recreating the TanStack Start request context in unit tests.

Usually do not test generated route discovery, routine navigation, static markup, shadcn primitives, trivial wrappers, implementation details, or framework behavior. Route tests are justified when custom search parsing, guards, redirects, or error behavior is itself product logic.

## Test Design

- Test public behavior and meaningful outcomes, not internal call structure.
- Prefer a few focused happy-path, boundary, failure, and regression cases. Table-driven tests are useful when the same contract has several inputs.
- Prefer real implementations when they are local, fast, deterministic, and side-effect free. Do not add mocks by default.
- Do not use snapshots or add tests solely to increase coverage.

## Third-Party Integrations

Default test commands must not call remote third-party services. They may use disposable owned dependencies and provider fakes running on localhost. Exercise owned integration behavior through the real application boundary with representative fixtures or a local fake instead of mocking internal implementation details. Sanitize provider-derived fixtures before committing them; never include secrets, payment details, or personal data.

A small, separately invoked sandbox integration suite may call a provider's official test environment when that proves behavior that cannot be established locally, such as authentication, SDK compatibility, hosted flows, webhook delivery, or provider configuration. Sandbox tests must:

- use only sandbox-scoped credentials and resources, never production;
- isolate their data and clean up when the provider supports it;
- account for rate limits and run serially when shared provider state makes parallel execution unsafe;
- stay focused on representative compatibility and smoke paths while deterministic state permutations remain local;
- remain outside routine pull-request checks unless they are demonstrably reliable.

Test application-owned integration behavior locally, including calculations, external event validation and handling (e.g., webhooks and callbacks), lifecycle boundaries, idempotency, and user-visible states. Reserve an external service's official sandbox for the explicit integration path.

## Local Test Database

- Prefer the PostgreSQL service declared in `docker-compose.yml` over a system PostgreSQL installation. Confirm the underlying Docker or Podman engine works; a Compose wrapper alone is not sufficient.
- For finite integration or E2E runs, start only the PostgreSQL service. Check whether it was already running, and stop it afterward only if the current testing session started it.
- When Playwright targets a different database from the Compose default, create it once inside the container using the configured database user, then apply existing migrations with the test `DATABASE_URL` before running tests.
- Fall back to system PostgreSQL only when no usable Compose engine or database service is available.

## Conventions and Commands

- Colocate Vitest tests with source code as `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`. Put Playwright tests under `e2e/` as `*.spec.ts`. Do not create a `__tests__` directory unless a feature has enough test-only files to justify grouping them.
- Import Vitest APIs from `vite-plus/test`.
- `vpr test`: Run all Vitest unit and local integration tests once.
- `vpr test watch`: Run the Vitest suite in watch mode.
- `vpx playwright install chromium`: Install the E2E browser once per machine.
- `vpr test:e2e`: Build the app and run its E2E suite against the built production server.

Playwright must exercise built production output so the E2E path validates the deployable artifact, including production bundling and server/client boundaries. The Playwright configuration owns its build and server lifecycle; do not run a separate build first or reuse a development server. Use a targeted Playwright spec when iterating if the full E2E suite becomes slow.

Run the narrowest relevant test after changing behavior. Run Playwright whenever a change affects a covered browser journey; it remains separate from the default lint/check loop so unrelated changes stay fast.
